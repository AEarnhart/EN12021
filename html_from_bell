How much popcorn?
<!-- Each input has several attributes:
     id: What this thing is called in the HTML page, if we want to style it
         with CSS or control it with Javascript.
     name: What the data is called when we send it to the server
     value: The text that the thing should start with when we load the page

     These don't have to be unique; making the name and id the same is totally
     fine unless it confuses you.
